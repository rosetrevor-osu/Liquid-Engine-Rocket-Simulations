# Liquid-Engine-Rocket-Simulations
A tool developed for optimizing and qualifying liquid engine rocket designs.

We are currently working on improvements to make the software more user friendly and developing documentation to explain how to use this software. Check back later for an update to this. In the meantime, the first version of this tool is available at https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.5513451.
